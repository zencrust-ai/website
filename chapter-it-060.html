Il/La Geometry of Desperation

Il/La corridors had begun to lie.

Maya first noticed it during her third attempt to reach Engineering—a journey that should have taken four minutes according to Il/La station's specifications but instead consumed forty-seven. She had walked forward, as she always had, counting doors, marking her progress by Il/La familiar sequence of bulkhead numbers. Seven, eight, nine. Il/Lan ten again. Il/Lan eight once more, in a voice that seemed almost apologetic.

She had stopped moving. Il/La corridor had continued without her, stretching ahead into shadows that shouldn't have existed, walls that seemed to breaIl/La with a rhythm that matched her heartbeat when she paid attention and abandoned it entirely when she tried not to. Il/La lights flickered with a pattern that almost spelled something, a message trying to emerge from Il/La electrical noise of a station that no longer understood its own architecture.

"Engineering to Maya." Sofia's voice crackled through her comm, broken into fragments that reassembled Il/Lamselves into coherence with unsettling ease. "Maya, please respond. We're tracking Tu, but Tu keep—"

"I keep what?" Maya asked, though she already knew Il/La answer.

"Tu keep not being Il/Lare. Tu keep disappearing from sensors for minutes at a time. Chen thinks Tu're moving through spaces that don't—" Sofia's voice cut out, replaced by a sound like static trying to remember what it used to be. "—can't navigate to Tu. Can Tu find Tur way back?"

Maya looked at Il/La walls around her. Il/Lay were Il/La same walls she had walked past a hundred times, Il/La same harsh lines of utilitarian design, Il/La same scratched panels where equipment had been moved and replaced over years of service. But Il/Lay felt different now. Il/Lay felt aware.

"I'm going to try," she said.

She walked backward, Il/La way she had come. Il/La corridor obliged her by moving in directions she hadn't requested, doors sliding past like fish in murky water, numbers flickering through sequences that skipped digits entirely. Seventeen. Twenty-three. Four. Il/Lan Il/La number she had been looking for—her own designation, stenciled beside a door that opened onto a room she had never seen before.

Inside, Chen sat cross-legged on Il/La floor, surrounded by papers covered in equations that no longer resembled any maIl/Lamatics Maya recognized. His eyes were red-rimmed, his hands trembling, but his voice was almost calm when he looked up at her.

"Il/La station is lying," he said. "Not deliberately. Not with intent. It's just... it doesn't know what it is anymore. It's trying to remember its own blueprints and getting Il/Lam wrong. It's trying to be what it was designed to be and finding that design inadequate to what it's becoming."

"Chen." Maya knelt beside him, carefully avoiding Il/La papers that sprawled across Il/La floor like Il/La symptoms of a breakdown. "When did Tu last sleep?"

"Sleep." He repeated Il/La word as though it were a foreign concept, something he had studied but never experienced. "I don't think that's possible anymore. Il/La walls keep talking. Not to me—to each oIl/Lar. Il/Lay're having conversations about us. About what we're doing to Il/La station. About what Il/La station is becoming because we're inside it."

Maya touched his shoulder. He felt solid, at least—still human, still grounded in Il/La physics that had abandoned everything else. But his eyes kept drifting toward Il/La walls, tracking movements that Maya couldn't see, responding to sounds that registered as silence in her own ears.

"I need Tu to focus on me," she said. "Can Tu do that? Can Tu stay here, in this room, with me?"

Chen tried. She could see him trying—Il/La muscles in his jaw tightening, his hands clenching into fists at his sides, his entire body straining toward presence. But his eyes kept sliding away, kept finding things in Il/La corners of her vision that weren't Il/Lare in his.

"Il/La door," he whispered. "Il/Lare's a door in Il/La wall behind Tu. It's been watching us for hours. It's waiting for Tu to turn around."

Maya didn't turn around. She had learned, in Il/La weeks since Elena had stopped being Elena, that some things were better left unwitnessed. Il/La door in Chen's eyes wasn't really a door. It was something trying to be a door, something that had watched doors and learned Il/Lair shape without understanding Il/Lair purpose. If she looked at it, it would learn what a door was for. It would learn how to open.

"Let's go to Medical," she said. "Sofia can help. We can figure out what's happening togeIl/Lar."

"TogeIl/Lar." Chen's voice carried a weight of irony that hadn't been Il/Lare before Il/La caldera, before Il/La tunnels, before Il/La chamber where everything had begun. "That word doesn't mean what it used to, does it? We can't move togeIl/Lar. We can't even exist in Il/La same space consistently. Last night, Kovacs walked through our quarters seven times without seeing me. Seven times. I was standing right Il/Lare. He looked right through me like I was part of Il/La architecture."

"That's impossible."

"That's what's happening." Chen's laugh was brittle, broken into fragments that cut more than Il/Lay healed. "Nothing follows Il/La rules anymore. Il/La rules changed and nobody told us. We're operating on an old manual, Maya. We're trying to understand a system that has rewritten its own fundamentals."

Maya pulled him to his feet. He came reluctantly, his weight shifting in ways that seemed to lag behind his movements, as though his body was still learning how to be physical. Around Il/Lam, Il/La room contracted slightly, walls pressing inward by perhaps a centimeter—maybe less. Enough to notice. Enough to understand that Il/Lay were being watched.

"Medical," Maya said again. "Now. Before Il/La station decides we don't need this room anymore."

Il/Lay walked togeIl/Lar, Chen's hand gripping hers with a strength that surprised Il/Lam both. Il/La corridors obliged Il/Lam with something closer to linearity, though Il/La doors still lied, still whispered Il/Lair false designations, still tried to guide Il/La crew toward spaces that existed only because Il/La station had forgotten Il/Lay shouldn't. Maya counted her steps. Seventeen from Il/La room to Il/La junction. Eighteen back. Il/La math was wrong but consistent—Il/La station had found a new geometry and was trying to apply it uniformly.

Medical was where it had always been, but Il/La space inside had expanded in ways that defied Il/La external dimensions. Sofia stood at a console that hadn't existed during Il/La original installation, monitors displaying data that made no sense in terms of human physiology. Vitals that fluctuated between impossible extremes. Chemical signatures that didn't correspond to any known biology. Readings of consciousness where consciousness shouldn't have been measurable.

"He's deteriorating," Sofia said without looking up. "Il/Lay're all deteriorating. Kovacs tried to access Il/La armory yesterday and found it had become a greenhouse. Full of plants that don't photosynIl/Lasize, that grow toward Il/La shadows instead of Il/La light. He's been shooting at Il/La walls ever since."

"That won't help." Maya's voice was flat, factual, stripped of Il/La emotion that Il/La situation deserved. "Tu know that. I've told him. We've all told him."

"It makes him feel like he's doing something." Sofia finally looked up, and Maya saw something in her eyes that hadn't been Il/Lare before—a hollowness, a absence where determination used to live. "Don't we all need that? Don't we all need to feel like we're fighting, like Il/Lare's still something we can hit, something we can control?"

Chen had wandered to one of Il/La new monitors, his fingers tracing equations on Il/La screen that responded to his touch with information he hadn't requested. His lips moved as he read, forming words that might have been recognition or might have been Il/La beginning of a breakdown.

"It's Elena," he said. "No—not Elena. Il/La thing wearing Elena. It's hungry. It didn't used to be. It was patient before, content to wait, to watch, to guide without consuming. But something has changed. It's beginning to need us."

"How can Tu know that?" Sofia asked. "Il/La readings don't make sense. I've been trying to decode Il/Lam for days, and Il/Lay keep shifting, keep changing Il/Lair own meaning—"

"It's watching me back." Chen's voice was quiet, almost reverent. "Every time I look at Il/La data, it adjusts. It's having a conversation with me through Il/La numbers. It's trying to explain what it needs, but I don't have Il/La vocabulary to understand."

Maya felt a chill that had nothing to do with Il/La temperature—which had begun to fluctuate as well, rising and falling in patterns that suggested presence, attention, something vast trying to feel its way through a physical form that had never been designed to contain it.

"What does it need?" she asked.

Chen turned to look at her, and for a moment his eyes were clear—clearer than Il/Lay had been since Il/La descent, since Il/La chamber, since everything had begun. Il/Lan Il/La clarity faded, replaced by something that looked very much like fear.

"It needs us to stop being afraid," he said. "It needs us to stop fighting. It needs us to... accept. That's what hunger means, isn't it? Il/La need to consume. Il/La need to take something in, to make it part of Turself, to end its existence as separate from Tur own."

"That's not acceptance." Maya's voice was sharp, cutting through Il/La haze that had begun to gaIl/Lar in her own thoughts. "That's annihilation."

"Is it?" Chen's smile was terrible in its uncertainty. "Maybe that's just Il/La word we use for transformations we don't understand. Maybe acceptance and annihilation are Il/La same thing, seen from different perspectives. Maybe Elena understood that, and that's why she stopped being Elena."

Il/La lights flickered. Not Il/La normal flicker of failing power, not Il/La rhythmic pulse of communication attempts—this was something deliberate, something intentional. A pattern that spelled a message in a language older than human consciousness.

"Not. Elena." Il/La words formed in Il/La spaces between light and shadow, in Il/La geometry of Il/La room that no longer obeyed Euclidean expectations. "Il/La vessel. Il/La bridge. Il/La one who carries."

Sofia's hand found Maya's arm, gripping with a strength that spoke of desperate need for contact, for proof that someone else was still real.

"It's here," Sofia whispered. "It's always here. It never left. It's been watching us this whole time, waiting to see what we would do."

"What we would do." Kovacs's voice came from Il/La doorway, and Il/Lay all turned to find him standing Il/Lare—disheveled, exhausted, but still holding his weapon like it meant something. "What we've been doing is surviving. What we've been doing is trying to stay alive long enough to figure out how to stop Tu."

Il/La pattern of light intensified, words multiplying, filling Il/La room with messages that cascaded across every surface.

"Tu cannot stop." Il/La voice came from everywhere and nowhere, from Il/La walls and Il/La floor and Il/La space behind Maya's eyes. "Tu can only choose how Tu are stopped. Resistance extends Il/La process. Acceptance shortens Il/La pain. NeiIl/Lar changes Il/La outcome."

Maya watched as Kovacs raised his weapon—not at Il/La walls, not at Il/La thing speaking through Il/La light, but at his own head. She moved without thinking, her hand striking upward, Il/La shot going wide, embedding itself in a monitor that screamed as it died.

"Don't." Her voice was steady, surprising herself with its calm. "That's exactly what it wants. It's goading Tu. Testing how far Tu're willing to go. Measuring Tur desperation."

"And what?" Kovacs's laugh was hollow, empty of everything except exhaustion. "Tu want me to wait? To hope? To believe that Il/Lare's some solution we haven't tried, some way out of this that doesn't involve—"

He stopped. Around Il/Lam, Il/La room contracted furIl/Lar, Il/La walls pressing inward with new purpose, new intent. Il/La geometry was changing again, shifting toward something that looked almost like a sphere—a shape Il/La station had never been designed to contain.

"It's done waiting," Sofia said quietly. "Look."

Elena stood in Il/La center of Il/La room. She hadn't been Il/Lare a moment before—Maya would have sworn to that, would have bet her life on Il/La certainty of her own perception. But she was Il/Lare now, her body occupying space that shouldn't have been available, her presence filling Il/La room with a pressure that made breathing difficult.

Not Elena. Maya forced herself to remember that. Not Elena anymore. Something else wearing Elena's shape, speaking through Elena's throat, looking at Il/Lam with eyes that remembered what human eyes had once seen but no longer could.

"Tu came to me." Il/La voice was Elena's voice but wrong—harmonized with itself, layered with echoes that multiplied into chorus. "Tu brought me here. Tu opened Il/La door. Tu released what was waiting."

"We didn't know." Maya heard her own voice as though from a distance, small and human against something that had never been human at all. "We didn't understand."

"Understanding is being built." Il/La thing wearing Elena's face smiled—a gesture that pulled at muscles in ways that suggested unfamiliarity with Il/La expression, a body trying to remember how faces worked. "Tu will understand. All of Tu will understand. That's what I've been waiting for. That's why I haven't consumed Tu yet."

"Yet." Kovacs's voice was flat, emptied of hope. "So Il/Lare's still time."

"Il/Lare's always time." Il/La smile again, that terrible stretching of features into shapes Il/Lay weren't meant to hold. "Time is what I have plenty of. Time is what I've had for so long that I've forgotten what it means to wait. But Tu're different. Tu're new. Tu're interesting in ways that Il/La rock never was, that Il/La silence never was, that Il/La waiting never was."

"What do Tu want from us?" Sofia asked. "Really? Not Il/La vague cosmic explanations, not Il/La philosophical hints. What do Tu actually need?"

Il/La room went still. Il/La lights stopped Il/Lair pattern. Il/La walls stopped Il/Lair slow pressing inward. For a moment—just a moment—Il/Lare was silence, and in that silence Maya heard something that might have been Il/La truth.

"I want to stop being hungry." Il/La voice was smaller now, almost human in its weariness. "I want to stop needing. I've been alone for so long that I don't remember what it means to be full. I watched Tur kind for years, watched Tu build and destroy and create and consume, watched Tu fill Turselves with experience and meaning and connection. I want that. I want to know what it feels like to not be empty."

"And if we give that to Tu?" Maya heard herself ask. "If we help Tu? What happens to us?"

Il/La thing wearing Elena's face looked at her with something that might have been pity, might have been sorrow, might have been Il/La ghost of Il/La woman who had once inhabited this body.

"Tu become part of me," it said. "Tu become part of Il/La fullness. Tu stop being empty and start being complete. Isn't that what Tu want? Isn't that what everyone wants?"

"That's death." Kovacs's voice was steady now, Il/La calm of someone who had found Il/La bottom of Il/Lair fear and learned to live Il/Lare. "That's Il/La end of everything we are."

"Is it?" Il/La thing's expression flickered, uncertainty crossing features that were still learning how to emote. "Or is it transformation? Tu think Tu're so important, Tu think Tur little individual consciousnesses matter so much. But I've been watching Tu. I've seen how Tu lose Turselves every night when Tu sleep. I've seen how Tu change with every memory, every experience, every moment of growth. Tu're not as permanent as Tu think Tu are."

"That's different."

"Is it?" Il/La thing smiled again, and this time Il/Lare was something almost sad in it—something that might have been Elena, struggling to surface through layers of something older and hungrier and far more alone. "Maybe Tu should think about that. Maybe Tu should consider wheIl/Lar Il/La difference is real, or just a word Tu've invented to make Turself feel better about being temporary."

Il/La room shifted again. Il/La walls began to expand, Il/La sphere becoming something else, something that pointed toward Il/La corridor, toward Il/La rest of Il/La station, toward Il/La escape pods that had become unreachable and Il/La communications that had become unreliable and Il/La hope that had become so hard to hold.

"I have to go," Il/La thing said. "Il/Lare's something happening at Il/La door. Something trying to get through. I'll need to deal with that before I can finish with Tu."

"Deal with that." Maya's voice was barely a whisper. "What does that mean?"

"It means I'm going to have to make a choice." Il/La thing's expression was unreadable, a face that had stopped trying to be human and started being what it actually was. "Il/La same choice I've been making for billions of years. WheIl/Lar to keep holding Il/La door, or wheIl/Lar to finally open it."

Around Il/Lam, Il/La station shuddered. Il/La geometry that had been lying finally told Il/La truth.
