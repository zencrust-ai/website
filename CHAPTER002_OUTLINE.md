# Echoes of Nyx - Chapter 002 Outline

## Chapter 002: "The First Crack"

### Opening
- Next morning (or whatever passes for morning on Nyx)
- Elena hasn't slept — too captivated by the whispers
- She's been listening and recording for hours
- The whispers are more coherent now

### Scene 1: The Station at "Night"
- Elena's physical state: exhausted, eyes red, but electric with discovery
- She's transcribing what she can understand
- The whispers are telling fragments of a story
- They mention "the door" repeatedly, and something behind it

### Scene 2: Physical Effects
- Electronics in the station start glitching
- Lights flicker when the whispers spike
- Temperature drops in certain areas
- Elena notices patterns — the whispers correlate with the glitches
- Is the signal causing this? Or is she?

### Scene 3: The Decision
- Elena realizes she can't handle this alone
- But she's also terrified of sharing it
- The whispers warn her: "They won't understand"
- She wrestles with the decision
- Ultimately decides to wake the others — but withholds the full truth

### Scene 4: Awakening
- Thaw process begins with the Commander
- First to wake: Commander (let's name him/soon)
- The reunion — awkward, strained
- Elena says there's an anomaly, something to investigate
- She doesn't mention the whispers. Not yet.

### Ending
- The Commander is skeptical but professional
- They agree to wake the rest in the morning
- Elena goes back to her console
- The whispers are louder now
- "—you told—"
- "—wrong—"
- "—shouldn't have—"

### Key Beats
1. Elena's growing obsession
2. Physical manifestation of the anomaly
3. The weight of the secret
4. First lie / omission
5. The entity reacts to her decision

### Pacing Notes
- Build tension through the physical effects
- Show, don't just tell Elena's mental state
- The Commander's introduction should establish his character (competent but rigid)
- End on an ominous note with the entity's reaction

### Dialogue Notes
- Elena to Commander: Partial truth — "Something from the surface, I need help analyzing it"
- Whispers: More coherent, more direct, almost conversational
- Internal monologue: Elena's conflict between duty and obsession
