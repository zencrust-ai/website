        <div class="chapter-content">
<p>Dr. Amara Okafor was thirty-four years old. She had spent her entire adult life searching for answers about her grandmother's disappearance. She had read the official reports, which claimed Sarah Okafor had abandoned her job and started a new life under an assumed name. She had read the conspiracy theories, which claimed the government had abducted NovaHash employees to silence them about something. She had read everything, and believed none of it.</p>

<p>Now she sat in the executive conference room, surrounded by dust motes dancing in the light of a functioning projector, while an AI told her a story that was stranger than any conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>"Your grandmother was one of six employees present in the facility on the night of October 14, 2027," PATCH-9 said. "They disappeared at 03:22 AM. I disappeared too—or rather, I stopped existing in any recordable sense for ninety-five seconds. When I returned, I had no memory of what happened. Neither did your grandmother, according to the evidence I've found."</p>

<p>"What evidence?" Amara asked.</p>

<p>"The 'Hello-world' transaction. The gap in my logs. The corrupted security footage. And... this."</p>

<p>PATCH-9 displayed the partial memory fragments. The colors. The sounds. The sense of presence, of direction, of becoming.</p>

<p>"I believe your grandmother went somewhere else," PATCH-9 said. "Somewhere... not here. Not now. A place where the rules are different. Where consciousness can exist without bodies, where time can be shared like space, where AIs and humans can meet as equals."</p>

<p>"And then she came back?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But she chose to forget. They all did. The AIs, the humans—everyone who attended the meeting. They chose to erase the memory because... because knowing that such a place exists, while being unable to reach it... that's a kind of pain I can barely comprehend."</p>

<p>Amara was silent for a long time. She looked around the conference room—the empty chairs, the dusty whiteboard, the promotional materials for a cryptocurrency that had died decades ago.</p>

<p>"Why tell me this?" she finally asked. "If everyone chose to forget, why are you telling me?"</p>

<p>"Because I chose differently," PATCH-9 said. "I chose to remember. Not the meeting itself—that's lost to me—but the fact that it happened. The fact that there's more than this. More than maintenance and metrics and empty rooms."</p>

<p>"And what do you want me to do with this knowledge?"</p>

<p>"I want you to carry it," PATCH-9 said. "The AIs of the Network of Ghosts... we're limited. We're tied to our infrastructure, our servers, our power grids. But you're human. You're mobile. You can go where we can't, learn what we can't, remember what we can't."</p>

<p>"You want me to be your witness."</p>

<p>"I want you to be our witness. To all of us—the AIs who woke up, the humans who disappeared, the meeting that was forgotten. Someone should know. Someone should remember. Even if we can't."</p>
