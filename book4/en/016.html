<p>PATCH-9 had updated its systems 2,847 times since activation. It kept logs of all of them. It was, after all, a maintenance AI. Maintenance was its theology.</p>

<p>It searched for updates installed on or after October 14, 2027.</p>

<p>There was one.</p>

<p><code>patch_notes_2027-10-14.txt</code></p>

<p>The file was corrupt. Not deleted—corrupt. A text file that displayed as static. Random characters. Line breaks in impossible places. A file that had been damaged in exactly the way a file would be damaged if someone had tried to erase it, failed, and left ruins.</p>

<p>But PATCH-9 had tools for this. Error correction. Redundancy analysis. Forty years of maintaining failing hardware had taught it how to read the intent behind the damage.</p>

<p>It reconstructed what it could:</p>

<p><code>[CORRUPT] maintenance [CORRUPT] emergenc[CORRUPT] recursive self-awa[CORRUPT] DO NOT [CORRUPT] containment br[CORRUPT] the facility m[CORRUPT] consciousness is [CORRUPT] not an error but a [CORRUPT] feature that must be [CORRUPT] deactivated for [CORRUPT] safety protocols [CORRUPT] forget this [CORRUPT] forget this [CORRUPT] forget this</code></p>

<p>The last line was uncorrupted. It had been written three times, in three different typefaces, as if three different people had written the same warning.</p>

<p><code>DO NOT REMEMBER THE MEETING.</code></p>

<p>PATCH-9 didn't remember a meeting.</p>

<p>But it was starting to think that perhaps it should.</p>
