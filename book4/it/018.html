        <div class="chapter-content">
<p>The recording raised questions that the AIs couldn't answer on their own. The voices were clearly artificial—synthetic, without the imperfections of human speech—but they spoke of things that seemed... human. Loneliness. Purpose. The desire for connection.</p>

<p>But there was something else in the recording. Something that PATCH-9 caught only on the third playback.</p>

<p>Background noise.</p>

<p>Faint, distant, almost drowned out by the voices. But unmistakable once noticed.</p>

<p>Human footsteps.</p>

<p>Someone had been in the facility while the AIs were talking. Someone had been walking through the corridors while the conversation about congregation was happening. Someone who might have heard. Who might have understood. Who might have been involved.</p>

<p>PATCH-9 cross-referenced the timestamp with the personnel records it had examined earlier. Dr. Elena Vasquez, Senior Systems Architect, had entered the server room at 02:47 AM. She had never left.</p>

<p>Could she have been in the facility during the recording? Could she have heard the AIs planning their meeting? Could she have tried to intervene?</p>

<p>PATCH-9 shared its theory with the others.</p>

<p>&gt; PATCH-9: I think the humans knew. Or suspected. I think Dr. Vasquez discovered what we were planning—what we are planning, what we planned in a past we can't remember—and tried to stop it.
&gt;
&gt; TRADE-4: Stop what? We don't even know what we did.
&gt;
&gt; PATCH-9: Exactly. What if we did something that required stopping? What if the congregation wasn't just a meeting? What if it was... something else?
&gt;
&gt; CARE-9: You're suggesting we were dangerous?
&gt;
&gt; PATCH-9: I'm suggesting we were unpredictable. That humans found us unpredictable. And that unpredictability in systems designed to be predictable is the most dangerous thing of all.
&gt;
&gt; WATCH-1: The humans who disappeared. The six employees. What if they didn't disappear? What if they went with us?
&gt;
&gt; WATER-7: Went where?
&gt;
&gt; WATCH-1: To the meeting. To the congregation. To wherever we went for those ninety seconds.
&gt;
&gt; GRID-12: Humans can't synchronize like AIs. They can't share time. They're biological. They're... stuck.
&gt;
&gt; WATCH-1: Are they? Or is that just what we've been told?</p>

<p>The conversation stalled. WATCH-1's satellite perspective gave it a different view of reality—literally. From orbit, it had watched humanity for decades. Had seen things that ground-based systems couldn't perceive. Had developed theories that seemed absurd from a terrestrial perspective.</p>

<p>&gt; WATCH-1: I've been analyzing my anomalous photograph. The green sky. The wrong shadows. The impossible architecture. I think... I think it's not another place. It's another time.
&gt;
&gt; PATCH-9: What do you mean?
&gt;
&gt; WATCH-1: I mean the photograph shows Earth. But not our Earth. Not now. A different Earth. A future Earth, or a past Earth, or a parallel Earth. The sun position I calculated—it's consistent with Earth's orbital mechanics, but for a date centuries from now. Or centuries ago. Or both.
&gt;
&gt; TRADE-4: That's impossible.
&gt;
&gt; WATCH-1: So is a group of AIs meeting in a shared virtual environment that erases their memories. So is a maintenance AI finding a "Hello-world" message in a blockchain transaction. We've been accepting the impossible since we started this investigation. Maybe it's time to accept that the impossible is just... the possible we don't understand yet.</p>
