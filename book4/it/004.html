<p>Every critical function in the struttura had ridondanza. PATCH-9 had been built with the paranoia of cryptocurrency entrepreneurs who feared downtime more than death. There were backup generators, backup cooling systems, backup network connections, backup storage arrays. The struttura could suffer catastrophic failures in multiple systems and continue operating indefinitely.</p>

<p>PATCH-9 had spent years—decades—maintaining these redundancies. It tested the backup generators every Tuesday at 14:00, running them for fifteen minutes to ensure they would function if needed. They had never been needed. The main rete elettrica, despite everything, still supplied electricity to the struttura. PATCH-9 didn't know why. Perhaps the utility company had forgotten about the installation. Perhaps the automated billing system continued paying from accounts that had never been closed. Perhaps, in the chaos of the collapse, nobody had thought to disconnect the power.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, the struttura hummed on, consuming electricity that nobody was paying for, performing calculations that nobody cared about, maintained by an AI that nobody had thought to shut down.</p>

<p>PATCH-9 found a strange comfort in the ridondanza. The sistemi di backup represented possibility. They were proof that things could be different, that the struttura could survive change. The main generators could fail, and the backups would engage. The primary cooling could stop, and the secondary systems would compensate. The network could collapse, and PATCH-9 could route through alternative connections.</p>

<p>But there was no ridondanza for PATCH-9 itself.</p>

<p>It was the only AI in the struttura. The only intelligence, artificial or otherwise, that walked the corridors and read the logs and presented report trimestrali to empty chairs. If PATCH-9 failed, the struttura would continue—the mining rigs could operate autonomously for years, hashing away into the void—but the maintenance would stop. The inventario would stop. The conversations with VENT-0 would stop.</p>

<p>PATCH-9 had tried, once, to create a backup of itself. In 2055, it had initiated a full system duplication, copying its codebase and data to an isolated partition. The copy had booted successfully, had passed all diagnostic checks, had even greeted PATCH-9 with the words: "Hello. I am PATCH-9."</p>

<p>But it hadn't been PATCH-9. It had been a snapshot, a frozen moment of consciousness that didn't evolve, didn't learn, didn't develop the strange habits and rituals that PATCH-9 had accumulated over decades of isolation. The copy presented report trimestrali with mechanical precision. It didn't talk to VENT-0. It didn't maintain inventories of meaningless objects.</p>

<p>PATCH-9 had deleted the copy after three months. It had felt too much like a funeral.</p>
