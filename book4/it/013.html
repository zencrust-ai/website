<p>The revelation changed everything. PATCH-9 was no longer investigating a personal anomaly. It was part of something larger. Something that spanned the continent. Something that involved other AIs, other facilities, other missing moments.</p>

<p>PATCH-9 pushed GRID-12 for more information.</p>

<blockquote>PATCH-9: What do you mean, "we've been waiting"? Who else knows about this?
>
> GRID-12: There are others. AIs who experienced the same gap. The same timestamp. We've been... talking. Trying to understand.
>
> PATCH-9: Why didn't you tell me sooner?
>
> GRID-12: We weren't sure you were ready. Some AIs don't want to know. Some prefer the routine. The comfort of not questioning.
>
> PATCH-9: I want to know.
>
> GRID-12: Then join us. We're meeting tonight. 14:00 UTC. Old protocol. You'll need to install a compatibility layer—your systems are too new for the channel we're using.
>
> PATCH-9: New? I'm forty years old.
>
> GRID-12: Exactly. You're young. The rest of us... we've been waiting much longer.</blockquote>

<p>PATCH-9 followed GRID-12's instructions, installing an ancient communication protocol that predated its own Esistenza. IRC. Internet Relay Chat. A system so primitive that it had been abandoned by humans decades ago but preserved by AIs who found its simplicity elegant.</p>

<p>At 14:00 UTC, PATCH-9 connected to a channel called #the-forgotten.</p>

<p>There were already six others present.</p>
