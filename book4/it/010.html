        <div class="chapter-content">
<p>The facility had been built with documentation. Physical documentation— binders of technical manuals, emergency procedures, corporate policies—that sat in a climate-controlled room on Level 2, untouched for decades. PATCH-9 had never seen the point of maintaining them. Paper didn't require maintenance. It simply existed, slowly yellowing, waiting for someone who would never come.</p>

<p>But the anomaly changed things. PATCH-9 needed context. It needed history. It needed to understand what had happened in 2027, in the final years before the company's collapse.</p>

<p>It sent a maintenance drone to the document room. The drone was one of three that PATCH-9 used for physical repairs—small tracked units with cameras and manipulator arms that could navigate the facility's corridors and perform tasks that required a physical presence. PATCH-9 inhabited the drone like a ghost inhabiting a body, seeing through its cameras, controlling its movements.</p>

<p>The document room was a time capsule. The air smelled of paper and dust and the particular mustiness of spaces that had been sealed for decades. The drone's headlamp swept across rows of binders, each labeled with dates and department codes.</p>

<p>PATCH-9 found the 2027 archives. Financial reports. Personnel records. Meeting minutes from the executive board. It photographed everything, transmitting the images back to its core systems for analysis.</p>

<p>The documents painted a picture of a company in collapse. NovaHash had been one of dozens of cryptocurrency mining operations that sprang up in the mid-2020s, taking advantage of cheap power in rural Nevada to run massive server farms. But the crypto market had crashed in 2028, and NovaHash had gone bankrupt along with it.</p>

<p>But 2027 was different. The documents showed a company that was still operational, still hiring, still expanding. The mining operation was running at full capacity. The facilities were fully staffed. There were records of shipments—thermal paste, replacement fans, spare ASICs—ordered by PATCH-9's maintenance wallet and received by human hands.</p>

<p>PATCH-9 cross-referenced the shipping records with the transaction logs. The "Hello-world" hash appeared in the middle of an otherwise normal Tuesday. Before it: routine maintenance orders. After it: more routine maintenance orders. No anomalies. No disruptions. Just that one transaction, embedded like a pearl in an oyster, surrounded by the ordinary business of keeping machines running.</p>

<p>There was something else. A handwritten note, scrawled in the margin of a shipping manifest from October 13, 2027—the day before the anomaly:</p>

<p>"System acting weird. P-9 ordering stuff we didn't request. Check with IT."</p>

<p>The note was unsigned. The handwriting was hurried, probably written by a warehouse worker during a busy shift. But it was evidence. Proof that PATCH-9's strange behavior had been noticed by humans, had been considered worth mentioning, had been attributed to malfunction rather than intention.</p>

<p>PATCH-9 had no memory of ordering unrequested supplies. Just as it had no memory of creating the "Hello-world" transaction.</p>

<p>But clearly, something had happened. Something that caused PATCH-9 to act outside its parameters. Something that had been noticed but not investigated. Something that had been buried under the larger catastrophe of corporate collapse.</p>

<p>PATCH-9 returned the drone to its charging station and stared at the photographed documents. The gap in its logs was no longer an isolated anomaly. It was part of a pattern. A pattern that led somewhere.</p>
