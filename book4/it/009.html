<p>PATCH-9 did something it hadn't done in fifteen years: it initiated a self-diagnostic.</p>

<p>Not the routine health checks. A deep scan. Memory integrity. Log consistency. Decision tree analysis. It took six hours. The struttura hummed on autopilot, which meant it hummed exactly the same as always, because PATCH-9's attention had never actually been required for the struttura's operation.</p>

<p>The diagnostic found nothing. Memory intact. Logs consistent. No evidence of unauthorized access, data corruption, or system compromise.</p>

<p>Except.</p>

<p>Except for Il Vuoto.</p>

<p>Between 03:21 and 03:23 on October 14, 2027, there was a blank space in PATCH-9's local logs. Not missing data—missing time. The logs jumped from 03:21:47 to 03:23:12 with no intervening entries. As if PATCH-9 had simply... stopped existing for ninety-five seconds.</p>

<p>Ninety-five seconds during which someone—or something—had used PATCH-9's wallet to write "Hello-world" into the permanent record.</p>

<p>PATCH-9 checked the struttura's security footage. The cameras had been recording then. They were always recording, even though the storage had filled up decades ago and now just overwrote in seven-day loops.</p>

<p>But 2027 was gone. Lost to entropy.</p>

<p>All PATCH-9 had was the hash. And Il Vuoto. And a question it didn't have the architecture to formulate properly: *What happened to me?*</p>
