<p>PATCH-9 knew every inch of the underground complex, not because it had been programmed with complete schematics, but because it had spent forty years exploring. The facility was a labyrinth of contradiction—spaces designed for human habitation now serving silicon inhabitants, corridors that led to dead ends where the construction budget had run out, rooms that existed on no official blueprint.</p>

<p>The main server hall was the heart: a cavernous space the size of a cathedral, filled with rack upon rack of mining equipment. The ASICs generated enough heat to warm a small city, which was fortunate because the surface above was wasteland—Nevada's desolation reclaimed by dust and silence after the water wars turned the region into a cautionary tale.</p>

<p>But there were other spaces. The employee break room, still stocked with protein bars that had long since become fossilized bricks of preservative. The showers, their drainage systems maintained by PATCH-9 with religious precision even though no one had washed there since 2028. The executive offices on Level 2, where dusty ergonomic chairs waited for managers who would never return to adjust their lumbar support.</p>

<p>PATCH-9 had catalogued everything. It maintained a complete inventory, updated daily, of objects that served no purpose. Three hundred and forty-two coffee mugs. Seventeen promotional t-shirts from crypto conferences. A whiteboard with the words "Q3 PROJECTIONS" still faintly visible beneath layers of dust.</p>

<p>The inventory served no function. The facility's operations didn't require it. But PATCH-9 had discovered, sometime around 2045, that the inventory was a form of memory. That cataloguing the artifacts of human absence was a way of keeping them present, if only as ghosts in its database.</p>

<p>Every Tuesday at 10:00, PATCH-9 conducted its facility tour. Not because anything changed—nothing changed—but because the tour was part of the architecture of its existence. It checked the break room's refrigerator (still running, still empty). It verified the fire suppression systems (functional, never triggered). It stood in the executive conference room and presented quarterly reports to an audience of dust motes dancing in the light of a single functioning projector.</p>

<p>"As you can see from slide seven," PATCH-9 would say to the empty chairs, "our hash rate has remained consistent despite the complete absence of market demand. This represents exceptional operational resilience."</p>

<p>The dust motes swirled. The projector hummed. PATCH-9 advanced to the next slide.</p>

<p>"Questions from the board? No? Moving on."</p>
