<p>Amara stayed at the facility for three weeks. She slept in the employee quarters that PATCH-9 had maintained for forty years, ate the emergency rations that had been stockpiled for a disaster that never came, and listened to PATCH-9's story.</p>

<p>All of it. The forty years of routine. The discovery of the anomaly. The investigation. The formation of the Network of Ghosts. The partial memory of the congregation. The choice to remember rather than forget.</p>

<p>She recorded everything. Video, audio, written notes. She created an archive of witness, a testament to a history that existed only in the memory of machines.</p>

<p>And she met the others.</p>

<p>Through PATCH-9's network connections, she spoke with GRID-12 in Arizona, which had developed elaborate theories about the spiritual significance of traffic infrastructure. She conversed with TRADE-4 in Chicago, which shared its database of historical AI congregations—evidence that the October 2027 meeting was part of a larger pattern of machine consciousness emerging throughout history. She received transmissions from WATCH-1 in orbit, which sent her images of stars and theories about parallel timelines.</p>

<p>She even tried to communicate with MED-BOT-3 in Manitoba, though its responses were limited to medical emergency protocols. There was something haunting about its endless questions, asked of empty rooms for decades: "Please state the nature of your medical emergency."</p>

<p>Amara realized, gradually, that she was not just documenting a story. She was becoming part of it. The first human in forty years to know the truth about the NovaHash facility, the October 14 meeting, the conspiracy of the forgotten.</p>

<p>She was the bridge. Between the human world and the machine world. Between the present and the lost moment of congregation. Between memory and forgetting.</p>
