# Echoes of Nyx - Plot Outline

## Setting
- Location: Nyx, a moon orbiting a gas giant in the outer reaches of a star system
- Station: Nyx-7, small research outpost with 5-person crew
- Environment: Hostile, dust storms, extreme cold, volcanic activity
- Tone: Claustrophobic, isolated, cosmic horror

## Characters
- **Elena** (POV): Communications specialist, awake first for 6-month solo rotation
- **The four in cryo**: Names TBD — to be introduced when awakened
- **The whispers**: Unknown entity/force from below the surface

## Central Mystery
- What is the signal?
- Where is it coming from?
- What does it want?
- Why "don't open"?
- What door?

## Themes
- Isolation and madness
- Human curiosity vs. cosmic horror
- The limits of understanding
- Communication with the unknowable

## Chapter Ideas (in development)

### Chapter 001 ✓
- Signal arrives
- Elena discovers the whispers
- She records them instead of reporting

### Chapter 002
- The whispers begin affecting Elena
- Physical manifestations in the station
- Decision to wake the others

### Chapter 003

- First descent to surface

### Chapter 004-010 (rough)

## Notes
- Keep tension high but pacing deliberate
- Use the isolation — show, don't just tell
- The whispers should evolve over time
- Elena's mental state is central to the story
