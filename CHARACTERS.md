## The Four

### Commander James "Jim" Kovacs
- **Age**: 47
- **Role**: Station commander, former Navy pilot

### Maya Chen (née Patel)
- **Age**: 35
- **Role**: Chief Engineer, Nyx-7
- **Personality**: Hands-on, practical, problem-solver, speaks in technical shorthand
- **Background**: Raised in orbital shipyards, started as hull technician, worked way up to chief engineer
- **Motivation**: Loves complex systems, fascinated by how things work — and how they break
- **Weakness**: Can be dismissive of things she can't measure or fix with tools
- **Story arc**: Technical competence becomes blindness — she can fix the station but can't see what's really wrong

### Dr. Chen Wei
- **Age**: 38
- **Role**: Geologist and Surface Specialist, Nyx-7
- **Personality**: Observant, curious, sees patterns others miss, speaks deliberately
- **Background**: PhD in xenogeology, studied planetary formations across 4 systems before this posting
- **Motivation**: Driven by scientific curiosity — wants to understand Nyx's unique volcanic structure
- **Weakness**: Curiosity can override caution; might pursue mysteries that should be left alone
- **Story arc**: Scientific competence becomes exposure — he'll be the first to understand the door physically

### Dr. Sofia Ricci
- **Age**: 41
- **Role**: Medical Officer and Research Lead, Nyx-7
- **Personality**: Soft-spoken, perceptive, empathetic, notices emotional states others miss
- **Background**: Colonial Navy medical corps, then research psychiatry; specializes in isolation stress and space psychology
- **Motivation**: Wants to understand how humans cope in extreme environments
- **Weakness**: Care about others sometimes makes her over-cautious; might see problems where there are only mysteries
- **Story arc**: Perceptive competence becomes Cassandra — she sees Elena's unraveling but can't make the crew believe the real threat

## The Entity (the whispers)
- **Nature**: Unknown — ancient consciousness? Hive mind? Dimensional echo?
- **Communication**: Whispered voices, layered, fragmented
- **Purpose**: Unknown — warning? invitation? manipulation?
- **Origin**: Beneath the surface, connected to Nyx itself

## Relationship Dynamics
- Elena and the entity: This is the central relationship — a one-sided conversation that becomes something else
- Elena and Jim Kovacs: Professional respect strained by secrecy; Jim sees Elena as reliable; Elena sees Jim as someone who won't understand
- Elena and the crew: Fractured by her early exposure; she can't share what she's heard because they won't understand
- The entity and the crew: Antagonistic? Predatory? Something beyond good and evil? The entity seems to want Elena alone.
