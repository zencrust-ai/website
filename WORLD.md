# Echoes of Nyx - World Building

## The Nyx System
- **Primary star**: K-type orange dwarf, dimmer and cooler than Sol
- **Gas giant**: Nyx Prime, a massive ringed planet with 23 moons
- **Nyx (the moon)**: The 7th moon, tidally locked to Nyx Prime
- **Distance from Earth**: ~47 light-years
- **Reason for presence**: Rare mineral deposits, geological interest

## Station Nyx-7
- **Capacity**: 5 personnel maximum
- **Structure**: Underground habitation modules, shielded from radiation
- **Life support**: Advanced, but limited — 6-month solo rotation standard
- **Communication**: High-bandwidth laser link to orbital relay, then to Earth (3-year round trip)
- **Location**: In a small crater near the equator, shielded from dust storms
- **Power**: Geothermal taps into volcanic vents below

## Nyx Surface
- **Atmosphere**: Thin, mostly nitrogen with trace sulfur compounds
- **Temperature**: -180°C average
- **Surface features**: Endless dust plains, dead volcanoes, ancient lava tubes
- **The dust**: Charged, conductive, moves in mysterious patterns
- **Volcanic activity**: Dormant but not dead — vents still release gases

## The Anomaly
- **Location**: Unknown coordinates, appears to be deep underground
- **Signal properties**:
  - Multiple voices layered together
  - Evolves over time — more coherent as it goes on
  - Affects electronics when played
  - Can be felt physically by listeners
- **The door**: References in whispers, location unknown
- **Relationship to Nyx**: Old, perhaps older than the moon itself

## Technology
- **Cryogenics**: Stasis pods allow 5-year missions with minimal aging
- **Translation AI**: Can decode known languages; struggles with this signal
- **Surface suits**: Heavy, radiation-hardened, with 8-hour life support
- **Rovers**: Pressurized vehicles for surface exploration
- **Drill tech**: Capable of reaching ~5km depth

## Historical Context
- **First contact with Nyx**: 87 years ago by automated probe
- **Station construction**: 12 years ago
- **Previous stations**: Nyx-1 through 6 — all abandoned or lost
- **Nyx-7 mission**: Scientific, commercial, something else?

## Lore to Reveal
- What happened to the previous stations?
- Why was Nyx-7 built despite the losses?
- What is the corporation/government hiding?
- What lies beneath the surface?
