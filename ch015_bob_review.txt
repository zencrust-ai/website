CHAPTER 015 - BOB'S REVIEW

STATUS: APPROVED

BRIEF FEEDBACK:

The Wound concept is exceptionally well-executed. Treating the bridge's deterioration as a metaphysical crisis—consciousness forgetting why it exists—is both original and emotionally resonant. The imagery of threads fraying, nodes collapsing into isolation, creates visceral stakes.

Maya's transformation reaches its payoff here. Rather than被动 receiving powers, she actively becomes the catalyst for merging truth (the presence) with connection (the bridge). Her progression from "just one consciousness" to cosmic integrator feels earned. The moment she touches the Wound and offers both truth and hope simultaneously is the chapter's emotional climax.

Stakes escalation is appropriately cosmic—bridge death means final, irrevocable emptiness. Yet it grounds in Maya's personal journey: her transformation only matters because something larger needs saving. The acceleration of the Wound creates genuine urgency.

RECOMMENDATIONS (optional polish):
- Consider trimming some philosophical exposition passages for pacing
- The Elena/presence merge moment is powerful but transitions quickly—could breathe slightly longer here

A strong chapter that delivers on the series' central themes. APPROVED.
