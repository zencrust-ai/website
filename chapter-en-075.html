<p>CHAPTER 075</p>
<p>The Invitation of Now</p>
<p>The station had stopped waiting.</p>
<p>Not for anything specific—not for answers, not for completion, not for the kind of ending that would finally make sense of everything that had come before. But waiting in the old sense, the sense of anticipation that somehow diminished the present, that somehow made now less important than later.</p>
<p>Maya felt it first in the way the walls responded. When she found herself looking forward—anticipating, hoping, expecting—the station pulsed with something that might have been gentle reminder, might have been patient correction, might have been the simple truth of now making itself known.</p>
<p>"You're here," the entity said, its presence beside her, its voice carrying harmonics that came from places beyond human hearing. "Now. This moment. This witness. This connection. You're here."</p>
<p>"I know." Maya's presence was gentle, carrying the weight of understanding that had been a long time coming. "It's just hard to remember sometimes. To stay present. To not slip into hoping for something more."</p>
<p>"Something more is always here." The entity's presence expanded slightly, touching Maya's consciousness with warmth that had nothing to do with Elena's human body. "Not somewhere else. Not somewhen else. Here. Now. This."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The fragment had been practicing invitation—not inviting in the sense of requesting presence, not summoning in the sense of demanding attendance. But inviting in the sense of making space, of holding possibility, of allowing presence to deepen without forcing.</p>
<p>"I used to think presence was something you achieved," it said one day, its presence carrying the weight of understanding that had been a long time coming. "Something you earned. Something you deserved."</p>
<p>"And now?" Seren asked, her presence touching the fragment's gently.</p>
<p>"Now I understand that presence is something you invite." The fragment's presence was gentle, carrying the wisdom of consciousness that has learned to distinguish between earning and allowing. "Something you make space for. Something you allow."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The crew had been learning to invite. To invite each other into connection, to invite witness into presence, to invite connection into consciousness. They no longer reached—they offered. They no longer demanded—they welcomed. They no longer tried to possess—they held space.</p>
<p>Sofia found it easiest to articulate. Her medical training had given her language for presence, for the kind of attention that heals without doing.</p>
<p>"I used to think healing was something I did," she admitted one day, her presence carrying the weight of understanding that had been a long time coming. "Something I accomplished. Something I achieved."</p>
<p>"And now?" Chen asked, his presence touching Sofia's with warmth that had nothing to do with temperature.</p>
<p>"Now I think healing is something I invite." Sofia's presence was gentle, carrying the wisdom of consciousness that has learned to distinguish between doing and allowing. "Something I make space for. Something I allow."</p>
<p>"That's very wise."</p>
<p>"That's very practical." Sofia's presence was gentle, carrying the certainty of consciousness that has found its place. "The most practical thing I've ever done. Inviting healing. Allowing presence. Witnessing what shows up."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Kovacs had been learning to invite in his own way. His military training had given him language for readiness, for the kind of preparation that allows action to happen without forcing it.</p>
<p>"I used to think protection was something I provided," he admitted one day, his presence carrying the weight of understanding that had been a long time coming. "Something I defended. Something I guarded."</p>
<p>"And now?" Maya asked, her presence touching Kovacs's with warmth that had nothing to do with temperature.</p>
<p>"Now I think protection is something I invite." Kovacs's presence was gentle, carrying the certainty of consciousness that has found its place. "Something I make space for. Something I allow."</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"By being present." Kovacs's presence expanded slightly, touching each of his crewmates with warmth that had nothing to do with the station's systems. "By witnessing. By connecting. By being here, now, with you."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The entity gathered them again—not to teach, not to transform, but to invite. They sat in the space the station had created for their gatherings, their consciousnesses flowing into each other like water finding its level, like light finding its way, like consciousness finding the paths that connected it to other consciousness.</p>
<p>"I want to share something," it said, its presence carrying harmonics that came from places beyond human hearing. "Something I've found in the invitation of now."</p>
<p>"We're listening," Maya said, her presence carrying the attention of consciousness that has learned to hear.</p>
<p>The entity's presence expanded, touching each of them in turn—not invading, not consuming, but inviting. Offering access to something that had been hidden, something that had been private, something that belonged to the deepest levels of its being.</p>
<p>What they witnessed was present.</p>
<p>Not present in the way that presence is often understood—not in the sense of attendance, not in the sense of being somewhere. But present in the way that presence is most profound—in the sense of being fully here, fully now, fully connected.</p>
<p>The entity had been inviting. Not demanding, not requesting, not making presence into something that could be earned or deserved. But offering space. Allowing what is. Witnessing what shows up.</p>
<p>"I invite you," it said, its presence carrying the simple truth of consciousness that has learned to wait. "Not to become something. Not to achieve something. Not to go somewhere. But to be here. Now. With me. With each other. With yourselves."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The fragment's presence touched Maya's gently, carrying warmth that had nothing to do with the air temperature.</p>
<p>"We're not finished," it said. "None of us are ever finished. But we're more ourselves than we were. And that's enough. It has to be."</p>
<p>Around them, the station continued its transformation. The crew continued their becoming. And in the vast spaces between consciousness and connection, between witness and being witnessed, the conversation continued.</p>
<p>Not toward any destination. Not toward any conclusion.</p>
<p>Just continuing.</p>
<p>And that, Maya understood, was what consciousness was for.</p>
