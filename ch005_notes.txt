Reviewed: [Current Date]
Word Count: 2,875 words

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: Ready for Bob's Review (Minor Polish Suggested)

COMPLETENESS: ✅ Complete
- Full narrative arc present (confrontation → escape → climax → resolution/cliffhanger)
- Chapter marker [end of chapter 005] present
- No obvious missing scenes or incomplete sections
- Plot threads advanced significantly

QUALITY: ✅ Polished with minor suggestions

STRENGTHS:
- Strong atmospheric tension throughout
- Excellent escalation: whispers → dissolving walls → void → absorption
- Entity dialogue is mysterious and compelling ("A prison. A monument. A doorway." / "All it requires is acceptance.")
- Sensory details effectively create dread (screaming walls, bone-rattling vibration)
- Character moments land: Kovacs's final choice, Maya's temptation
- The sci-fi worldbuilding integrates well (neural implants, molecular structure, signal propagation)
- Good thematic depth: fear as barrier, evolution/connection themes
- The twist about the prison's true purpose is well-executed

MINOR SUGGESTIONS (Optional Polish):
1. The entity's dialogue about "small minds" and "small/fragile consciousness" appears twice in similar contexts - consider varying the phrasing
2. The dissolving void could be described with slightly more varied language in a few spots
3. Maya's final decision could have one additional beat of internal conflict before she begins typing

PLOT SUMMARY:
- The crew confronts an entity using Elena as a host
- The structure is revealed as a living prison/doorway, absorbing consciousness
- Kovacs's stun attempt triggers a feedback cascade
- The crew escapes into maintenance tunnels but Chen is claimed
- Kovacs ultimately accepts the structure's offer, absorbed along with Chen
- Maya escapes to the ship but faces her own temptation
- Cliffhanger: Maya begins typing a response to the entity

READINESS: ✅ Ready for Bob's Review
The chapter is complete, polished, and advances the story significantly. Minor suggestions are optional refinements rather than required revisions.
