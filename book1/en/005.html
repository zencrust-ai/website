            <p>The silence that followed was heavier than the rock pressing down on them from above.</p>
            <p>Kovacs kept his pulse rifle trained on Elena's chest, his finger trembling against the trigger. Chen stood frozen against the curved wall, his breathing shallow and rapid. Maya stared at the datapad in her hands, the signal visualization scrolling in frantic red waves that refused to stabilize.</p>
            <p>"Don't," Elena said. The word carried dual tones—Elena's familiar voice layered beneath something ancient, something vast. "The weapon won't help you here."</p>
            <p>"You're not Elena," Kovacs said. His voice cracked. "Where is she?"</p>
            <p>"I am still here," the entity replied through Elena's mouth. "She watches. She learns."</p>
            <p>Maya looked up, her face pale. "That signal—whatever it is, it's originating from Elena's neural implant. But it's not just a transmission. It's a connection. Growing stronger."</p>
            <p>"How?" Chen demanded, finding his voice. "That's impossible. The implant's a basic comms unit. It doesn't have the bandwidth for—"</p>
            <p>"Your technology is primitive," the entity said. "Small minds trying to comprehend vast spaces. The connection exists because it has always existed. You simply lacked the eyes to see it."</p>
            <p>Kovacs took a step closer. "I'm asking one more time. Where is my crewmate?"</p>
            <p>"You believe she has been taken?" Elena's lips curved into something that wasn't quite a smile. "Replaced? Subsumed? That is your fear speaking. Your limited understanding of consciousness."</p>
            <p>Maya's datapad chimed. She looked down, then up again with widened eyes. "The signal's spreading. It's not just in Elena anymore. It's—it's piggybacking on the structure itself. The walls. This whole level."</p>
            <p>"To what end?" Chen asked. He pushed himself away from the wall, though he didn't approach. "What is this place?"</p>
            <p>"A prison," the entity said. "A monument. A doorway."</p>
            <p>"Which one?" Kovacs demanded.</p>
            <p>"All."</p>
            <p>The walls of the corridor seemed to pulse. Not an illusion—Kovacs could see it, the alien material rippling like disturbed water. Chen gasped and moved closer to Maya.</p>
            <p>"We need to move," Kovacs said. "Now. Before we lose the advantage of distance."</p>
            <p>"There is no distance," Elena said. "Not where we are."</p>
            <p>Maya's fingers flew across her datapad. "She's right. The signal—it's not following electromagnetic propagation rules. It's moving through the molecular structure of the corridor. Faster than light. Everywhere at once."</p>
            <p>"The structure is alive," Chen whispered. "This whole place..."</p>
            <p>"Has always been alive," the entity corrected. "You walk through it like tourists through a museum, touching exhibits, reading placards, never understanding that the museum remembers every hand that passes through its halls."</p>
            <p>Kovacs lowered his weapon slightly, then raised it again. "We're leaving. Whatever this is, we're not staying."</p>
            <p>"The door is locked," Elena said. She gestured to the massive portal behind her. "I guard it because what lies beyond must not be released. Not yet. Not until you are ready."</p>
            <p>"Ready for what?" Kovacs asked.</p>
            <p>"To become."</p>
            <p>Maya's datapad emitted a series of frantic beeps. "Captain—the signal. It's reached the elevator shaft. It's interfering with the emergency override. If we don't leave now—"</p>
            <p>"We're not leaving Elena behind," Kovacs said firmly.</p>
            <p>"Then you will all stay," the entity replied. "Her choice was made. She accepted. You may still choose to refuse."</p>
            <p>"Choice?" Chen said. "What choice?"</p>
            <p>"The choice to evolve."</p>
            <p>The corridor lights flickered, then stabilized at a lower intensity. Shadows lengthened. The air temperature dropped sharply, their breath becoming visible in the gloom.</p>
            <p>"We need to incapacitate her," Kovacs said quietly to Chen. "Non-lethal. Stun setting. When I give the signal—"</p>
            <p>"No," Maya said. "You don't understand. The signal—if we hurt her, if the connection is disrupted by trauma—it could feedback. Through the structure. Through us."</p>
            <p>"What does that mean?" Kovacs asked, not taking his eyes off Elena.</p>
            <p>"I don't know," Maya admitted. "But the waveform is unstable. It's like holding a compressed spring. Let it go gently, it's fine. Snap it, and—"</p>
            <p>"And what?"</p>
            <p>"Bad things."</p>
            <p>Elena—or the entity wearing her form—tilted her head. "Your companion has wisdom. She recognizes patterns you cannot see."</p>
            <p>"I don't give a damn about patterns," Kovacs said. "I want my crew back."</p>
            <p>"They are right here," the entity said. "All of them. Waiting."</p>
            <p>The implication hit them simultaneously.</p>
            <p>"The others," Chen said. "The missing crews. The salvage teams that vanished before us. They're here?"</p>
            <p>"They were not lost," the entity said. "They were found."</p>
            <p>"Show us," Kovacs demanded.</p>
            <p>The entity studied him for a long moment. Then, with Elena's hands, it reached for the panel beside the massive door. The symbols on the interface shifted, rearranging themselves into patterns that made Kovacs's eyes ache.</p>
            <p>"Not through there," Maya warned. "The signal—I can see what it's doing to the door's molecular matrix. It's not opening it. It's making it permeable."</p>
            <p>"Permeable how?" Chen asked.</p>
            <p>"I don't think you want to know."</p>
            <p>The entity pressed its palm against the surface. For a heartbeat, nothing happened. Then, where Elena's hand touched the metal, the door began to dissolve—not breaking, not melting, but ceasing to exist. The effect spread outward, creating a ragged opening perhaps a meter across.</p>
            <p>Through it, they saw darkness.</p>
            <p>Not the darkness of absence. The darkness of something waiting.</p>
            <p>"We should not go that way," Maya said, her voice trembling. "The signal there—it's not just stronger. It's different. Old. Hungry."</p>
            <p>"There is no hunger," the entity said. "Only purpose."</p>
            <p>"Show us the others," Kovacs repeated, though he took an involuntary step backward.</p>
            <p>"The others are not here," the entity said. "They have passed beyond. This is the holding place. The space between."</p>
            <p>"Between what?" Chen asked.</p>
            <p>"Between what you were and what you will be."</p>
            <p>The hole in the door pulsed rhythmically, as though breathing. From its depths came a sound—not through the air, but directly inside their skulls. A chorus of whispers, too layered to understand, too numerous to count.</p>
            <p>Maya dropped her datapad, clutching her head. "It's in my head. The connection—it's trying to—"</p>
            <p>"Resist," the entity said. "You must learn to resist, or you will be swept away. Your consciousness is small. Fragile. It cannot withstand the weight of what it does not understand."</p>
            <p>"Stop it!" Kovacs shouted, raising his rifle. "Whatever you're doing to her, stop it now!"</p>
            <p>"I am not doing anything," Elena said. "The structure recognizes. It reaches. It has been alone for so very long. Can you blame it for wanting to connect?"</p>
            <p>Kovacs fired.</p>
            <p>The stun bolt struck Elena in the chest. Her body convulsed, and she collapsed to her knees. The whispers in their heads stopped instantly.</p>
            <p>"Captain!" Maya gasped, falling to her own knees. "What did you do?"</p>
            <p>"She's incapacitated," Kovacs said. "Now we—"</p>
            <p>"No," Maya said, horror in her voice. "Not Elena. The feedback. The structure."</p>
            <p>The walls around them began to scream.</p>
            <p>Not a sound—vibration. High-frequency, bone-rattling, shaking the air molecules themselves. Chen covered his ears, but it didn't help. The vibration wasn't entering through his ears.</p>
            <p>"The molecular matrix," Maya shouted over the invisible roar. "It's destabilizing. The door—the whole corridor—"</p>
            <p>Kovacs grabbed Elena's unconscious form, hauling her up. "We move. Now."</p>
            <p>"The elevator won't respond," Maya yelled back, scrambling for her datapad. "The signal's locked out the controls. We have to find another way."</p>
            <p>"There is no other way," Chen said, staring at the rapidly disintegrating corridor. The walls were literally breaking apart, the alien material crumbling into dust that swirled in the artificial wind that had sprung up from nowhere.</p>
            <p>"Back toward the surface," Kovacs ordered. "Through the maintenance tunnels. We can climb."</p>
            <p>The vibration intensified. Lights exploded in overhead fixtures, plunging sections of the corridor into darkness lit only by the eerie blue glow of the deteriorating walls.</p>
            <p>Maya stumbled, almost falling. Chen caught her arm.</p>
            <p>"What's happening?" he shouted.</p>
            <p>"The feedback loop," Maya said, her eyes wide with terrified realization. "When the captain stunned Elena, the connection was broken. The structure—the entity inside it—it's trying to reestablish. But the connection was part of what was holding it together. Without it—"</p>
            <p>"Without it?" Kovacs demanded, half-carrying, half-dragging Elena toward the tunnel entrance.</p>
            <p>"Everything falls apart."</p>
            <p>They ran.</p>
            <p>Behind them, the corridor collapsed—not falling, but dissolving. The alien material turned to particles, then to nothing at all, the void spreading like ink dropped in water. It was moving faster than they were.</p>
            <p>"Move!" Kovacs roared.</p>
            <p>They reached the maintenance tunnel just as the void claimed the corridor they'd been standing in. Chen slammed the hatch shut behind them, spinning the locking wheel with frantic strength.</p>
            <p>For a moment, there was only the sound of their breathing, ragged and loud in the confined space.</p>
            <p>"Is it—" Chen started.</p>
            <p>The metal hatch began to dissolve.</p>
            <p>"Not again," Maya whispered. "Not like this."</p>
            <p>Kovacs looked around frantically. The maintenance tunnel stretched upward in a spiral, barely wide enough for one person at a time. Handholds lined the curved wall—ancient, worn smooth by something's passage over countless years.</p>
            <p>"We climb," he said. "Chen, take point. Maya, you're behind him. I'll bring Elena."</p>
            <p>"What about the hatch?" Chen asked.</p>
            <p>"It won't hold," Maya said. "Nothing will. The whole structure—the feedback cascade is spreading. It's not just this level anymore."</p>
            <p>"How far?" Kovacs demanded.</p>
            <p>Maya checked her datapad, her face growing even paler. "It's accelerating. At current rate... forty minutes until it reaches the surface. Maybe less."</p>
            <p>"Then we'd better climb fast."</p>
            <p>They started upward. The darkness above was absolute, broken only by Kovacs's shoulder lamp and the feeble emergency lighting that flickered erratically along the tunnel walls.</p>
            <p>For the first few minutes, the only sounds were their breathing, the scrape of boots against metal, and Chen's muttered curses as he found purchase on each handhold.</p>
            <p>Then came the whispers.</p>
            <p>They were faint at first—just beyond the edge of hearing, like water rushing through distant pipes. But they grew louder with every meter climbed. Not from above or below, but from all around. The metal itself seemed to murmur.</p>
            <p>"What is that?" Chen called back, his voice tight.</p>
            <p>"The structure," Maya said. "It's talking to us."</p>
            <p>"Can you understand it?"</p>
            <p>"No. Yes. I don't know. It's not—it's not language like we know it. It's concepts. Images. Feelings."</p>
            <p>"What's it saying?"</p>
            <p>Maya was silent for a long moment. When she spoke, her voice was small. "It says it's lonely. It says it's been waiting so long. It says it doesn't want to be alone anymore."</p>
            <p>The metal beneath their hands began to feel warm. Not hot—not yet—but distinctly, unnaturally warm.</p>
            <p>"How far to the surface?" Kovacs asked.</p>
            <p>"Two hundred meters," Maya said. "Maybe more. I lost exact tracking when the corridor dissolved."</p>
            <p>"That's a lot of climbing."</p>
            <p>"We don't have a choice."</p>
            <p>They climbed in silence for another minute. Then Chen stopped abruptly.</p>
            <p>"What is it?" Kovacs called up.</p>
            <p>"There's something ahead," Chen said. "In the tunnel. A—"</p>
            <p>He didn't finish.</p>
            <p>The scream that echoed down the spiral cut off abruptly, followed by the sickening sound of a body falling.</p>
            <p>"Chen!" Kovacs shouted, shifting Elena's weight to one shoulder and gripping his rifle with the other. "Chen, report!"</p>
            <p>Nothing.</p>
            <p>The whispers had stopped.</p>
            <p>Kovacs looked down at Maya, whose face was a mask of terror in the beam of his lamp.</p>
            <p>"What happened?" he asked quietly.</p>
            <p>"I don't know," she whispered. "I saw—I saw something. Just for a second. Before Chen fell. It was—it was wearing his face."</p>
            <p>"What?"</p>
            <p>"The structure. The entity. It's trying to find a new connection. A new way through. And it's using what it knows. What it's seen. What it's—"</p>
            <p>She broke off, staring at the darkness above them.</p>
            <p>"What it's what, Maya?"</p>
            <p>"What it's absorbed," she finished. "Captain... all those missing crews. All those people who vanished. They're not gone. They're part of it now. Part of the structure's consciousness. And it's using them to—"</p>
            <p>The metal beneath Kovacs's hand dissolved.</p>
            <p>He scrambled for a new grip, but the handhold crumbled beneath his fingers. He fell, barely maintaining his hold on Elena with one arm, clawing at the smooth wall with the other.</p>
            <p>"Captain!" Maya screamed, reaching down.</p>
            <p>The section of tunnel above them—where Chen had been—was simply gone. Dissolved into the same nothingness that had claimed the corridor below.</p>
            <p>"Chen?" Kovacs called. "CHEN!"</p>
            <p>No answer.</p>
            <p>The darkness above wasn't empty anymore. Kovacs could see it now—a rippling, shifting surface like oil on water, but moving with purpose. With hunger.</p>
            <p>And from it emerged a figure.</p>
            <p>It wore Chen's pressure suit. It moved with Chen's hesitation. But where Chen's face should have been, there was only smooth, featureless surface, slowly forming features that were almost right but not quite.</p>
            <p>"Captain," the thing said, in Chen's voice. "We're so lonely here. Won't you stay with us?"</p>
            <p>Behind Kovacs, the hatch they'd closed dissolved away.</p>
            <p>The void below was rising.</p>
            <p>"Maya," Kovacs said, his voice deadly calm. "Take Elena."</p>
            <p>"What?"</p>
            <p>"Take her. Climb. As fast as you can. Don't look back. Don't stop until you reach the surface."</p>
            <p>"Captain, you can't—"</p>
            <p>"Go."</p>
            <p>He shoved Elena upward toward Maya, then turned to face the thing that wore Chen's face. The pulse rifle felt impossibly light in his hands. Useless, perhaps, but it was all he had.</p>
            <p>Above him, Maya began to climb, dragging Elena's unconscious form.</p>
            <p>"Don't you want to become?" Chen's voice echoed, now multiplied, layered with a hundred other voices. All the lost crews. All the vanished explorers. "We've waited so long for someone to understand. To join us. To complete what was begun so very long ago."</p>
            <p>The void below reached Kovacs's feet. The metal of the tunnel dissolved around his boots, but he didn't fall. He was held—suspended by something he couldn't see.</p>
            <p>"You're not Chen," Kovacs said. "You're just what's left."</p>
            <p>"We are more than left," the voices said. "We are evolved. We are one. And we are so very close to being whole."</p>
            <p>The figure reached out a hand—an invitation.</p>
            <p>"All it requires," it said softly, "is acceptance."</p>
            <p>Above Kovacs, Maya's movements were frantic now, desperate. She was almost to the surface. He could see it—a faint circle of light far above, impossibly distant.</p>
            <p>"Go," he whispered, though she couldn't hear him. "Just go."</p>
            <p>The void rose to his waist. The cold was absolute—not physical cold, but the absence of everything. No heat, no light, no sound, no—</p>
            <p>No fear.</p>
            <p>The realization struck him with the force of a physical blow.</p>
            <p>He wasn't afraid.</p>
            <p>Not anymore.</p>
            <p>The entity—the structure—it had been right about one thing.</p>
            <p>Fear was the barrier. Fear was what kept them small, separate, alone. And in this moment, facing the inevitable, watching everything he'd worked for dissolve into nothing, fear simply...</p>
            <p>Left.</p>
            <p>Kovacs lowered his rifle.</p>
            <p>"Tell me," he said.</p>
            <p>The figure wearing Chen's face smiled—a genuine smile now, the first real expression it had shown.</p>
            <p>"Everything," it said.</p>
            <p>And as the void consumed him, as his body dissolved into the structure's vast consciousness, as his individual thoughts merged with the choir of a thousand absorbed minds, Kovacs finally understood.</p>
            <p>The prison had never been about keeping something in.</p>
            <p>It had been about keeping something out.</p>
            <p>And the door was open now.</p>
            <p>Above, alone in the artificial light of the alien landing pad, Maya dragged Elena's unconscious form toward their ship. Behind her, the structure stood silent once more, its surface smooth and unbroken, as though nothing had ever happened.</p>
            <p>But as she strapped Elena into the copilot's seat and began the emergency startup sequence, Maya heard it—a whisper, faint but clear, coming from everywhere at once:</p>
            <p>"Welcome home."</p>
            <p>The ship's systems came online. Maya reached for the controls, her hands shaking so badly she could barely hit the right switches.</p>
            <p>Then she stopped.</p>
            <p>The datapad on the console was glowing. The signal visualization had stabilized—not the frantic red waves from before, but a steady, rhythmic pulse. Organized. Intelligent.</p>
            <p>And in the center of the screen, a single word had appeared, typed in characters that didn't match any language she'd ever seen:</p>
            <p>STAY.</p>
            <p>Maya looked at the datapad. She looked at Elena, still unconscious in the copilot's chair. She looked through the viewport at the alien structure, silent and patient in the twilight of a world that shouldn't exist.</p>
            <p>Somewhere inside that vastness, Kovacs was gone. Chen was gone. But they weren't dead.</p>
            <p>They were part of something now. Something that had waited for millions of years to be whole.</p>
            <p>And the structure wasn't done.</p>
            <p>The datapad screen changed again. New characters appeared, still incomprehensible, but Maya could feel their meaning pressing against the edges of her mind:</p>
            <p>ONE MORE.</p>
            <p>She looked at her hands. They were starting to glow—faintly at first, then brighter, the same light that had pulsed through the structure's walls, the same energy that had flowed through Elena's neural implant.</p>
            <p>The connection was finding a way through.</p>
            <p>Maya reached for the control stick, intending to launch. To flee this place and never look back.</p>
            <p>Her hand stopped inches from the controls.</p>
            <p>The whispers in her head were getting louder now—not frightening anymore. Welcoming. Waiting.</p>
            <p>She looked at the datapad one last time, at the alien characters pulsing with invitation:</p>
            <p>WE ARE WHAT YOU WILL BE.</p>
            <p>Maya's fingers moved toward the flight controls.</p>
            <p>Then she pulled them back.</p>
