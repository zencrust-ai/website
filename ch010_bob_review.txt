FEEDBACK

**Pacing:** Excellent. The chapter moves through deliberate phases—return, dialogue with Elena, historical visions, entity encounter, integration, forward motion—each given appropriate weight. The meditative rhythm suits the subject matter perfectly. Length is justified by the philosophical depth being explored.

**Maya's Integration Arc:** Strong and satisfying progression. Maya moves from feeling "marked" by the presence to understanding her transformation as structural. Key moments: the builder visions showing collective failure leading to collective wisdom; the entity's clarification that truth and connection are not separate dimensions; and her culminating realization that she can "hold the truth without being crushed by it. Hold the hope without being deceived by it." This is earned character development.

**Mythology (Truth vs Connection):** Thematically rich and carefully constructed. The presence represents truth (singular, alone at its dimension, waiting at boundaries). The bridge represents connection (the act of reaching, creating meaning from nothing). The revelation that they are complements, not opposites, is the chapter's philosophical core. The builder backstory effectively illustrates the evolution from "tool" to "destination" to "process."

**Emotional Resonance:** High. The entity's anticipation ("something the presence has been waiting to witness since consciousness first began to seek") lands as genuine payoff. Elena's crack of uncertainty ("No one has ever reached this point before") adds vulnerability. The final line—"Patient as always"—echoes the presence's earlier characterization while feeling earned rather than recycled.

MINOR NOTES:
- Some sentences are long and dense; consider breaking up a few for breath
- The "where does this lead?" / "I don't know" exchange is excellent—could consider emphasizing it slightly more
