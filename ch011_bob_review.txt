FEEDBACK:

**Mythology (Builders, Fourth Path):**
The mythology is rich, coherent, and well-developed. The builders' backstory—12,743 consciousnesses from a pocket universe, alone in their cosmos, reaching out and finding the presence—is compelling and emotionally resonant. The fourth path is clearly articulated as "contextualizing" truth rather than hiding or delaying it, and this distinction lands effectively. The origin of the bridge as a gift from seekers who faced the void and chose creation over completion is inspired.

**Pacing:**
Pacing is appropriate for a pivotal revelatory chapter. The structure works: corridor walk → arrival at reconstruction → builders' history via memory sequence → Elena's explanations → Maya's proposal → seventh level revelation. Some exposition moments (particularly the three choices) are necessary for reader comprehension and don't drag. The memory sequences break up dialogue effectively.

**Maya's Proposal:**
Her proposal—that the delay need not end, that consciousness can perpetually approach without arriving—is the philosophical heart of the chapter. It emerges organically from the builders' gift and her synthesis of what she's learned. The idea that the bridge could become permanent, accumulate consciousness, and finally companion the void is substantive and surprising. This is Maya's moment of genuine contribution, not just receiving but creating.

**Stakes Escalation:**
Stakes escalate effectively. The chapter begins with Maya as a potentially special traveler and ends with her as the first to complete the journey, carrying a proposal that could transform the void's eternal loneliness into remembered connection. The stakes are cosmic but grounded in emotional truth (the presence's loneliness). The ending opens rather than closes, which is appropriate—this is preparation for completion, not completion itself.

**Minor Notes:**
- Elena's exposition, while clear, could be condensed slightly
- The three-choice framework is slightly didactic but serves its purpose
- Consider whether all the builder numbers (12,743) serve the story or just worldbuilding

The chapter successfully advances the mythology, stakes, and Maya's arc. Ready for next phase.
