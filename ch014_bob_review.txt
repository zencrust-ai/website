CHAPTER 014 REVIEW - Bob

STATUS: APPROVED

---

BRIEF FEEDBACK:

✅ Maya's Third Option: Excellent execution. The "eternal witness" concept emerges organically from the narrative—neither consumption nor integration, but perpetual relationship. Maya's realization that the Witness must be collective ("not one, but all") elevates the concept beyond a single hero's destiny.

✅ Stakes: Appropriately cosmic without hyperbole. The chapter establishes that this choice defines "the fundamental nature of reality itself" and that failure means either consumption or entropy. The temporal pressure ("time is not infinite") raises tension effectively.

✅ Mythology: Strong archetypal elements. The Witness as an eternal role, the presence as ancient truth seeking witness, the chain of consciousnesses stretching forever—these resonate with mythological traditions of the eternal witness/seeker. The evolution of the presence from hunger to gratitude is earned.

The prose carries the weight well. The climactic revelation of the third option feels inevitable rather than imposed. The collective nature of the Witness role prevents it from becoming a simple power-fantasy.

No revisions needed.
