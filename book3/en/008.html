            <p>Commander Reeves called the meeting at 0600, before anyone had slept.</p>
            <p>The six members of the Kepler Station crew gathered in the hub: Reeves, Elena, Samuel, Yuki, Dmitri Volkov (their engineer), and Aisha Patel (their communications specialist). They looked at each other with the hollow eyes of people who had seen too much in too short a time.</p>
            <p>"We have a situation," Reeves said. He didn't bother with formalities. They were past that. "Dr. Voss has been in contact with the alien artifacts for eleven days. During that time, we've observed significant changes in station systems, atmospheric composition, and—" he paused, glancing at Elena, "—crew psychology."</p>
            <p>"You're talking about me like I'm not here," Elena said.</p>
            <p>"I'm talking about you like you're a threat to this mission," Reeves replied. "Which you might be. We don't know. That's the problem."</p>
            <p>Yuki spoke up. "The spatial anomalies are getting worse. I've measured the corridors three times in the past week. They're shrinking. Slowly, but measurably."</p>
            <p>"And the atmospheric changes?" Reeves asked.</p>
            <p>Dmitri checked his tablet. "CO2 levels up twelve percent. Oxygen down eight. Humidity spiking unpredictably. It's like..." He hesitated. "Like something is breathing the air before we do."</p>
            <p>Aisha raised her hand, tentative. "I've been monitoring communications. There's... static. On frequencies that should be clear. And sometimes—sometimes I hear voices. Not human voices. Something else. Something speaking in patterns."</p>
            <p>Everyone looked at Elena.</p>
            <p>"It's the archive," she said quietly. "It's expanding. Learning the station the way it learned me. It needs a physical space to exist in, and it's... converting the station into that space."</p>
            <p>"Converting how?" Samuel asked.</p>
            <p>"I don't know the mechanism. But I can feel it happening. The walls, the air, the metal—it's all becoming resonant. Tuned to the same frequency as the crystals. The archive is turning the entire station into a... a receiver. For fear. For memory. For everything we are."</p>
            <p>Reeves was silent for a long moment. Then he pulled up the station's emergency protocols on the main screen.</p>
            <p>"Option one," he said. "We initiate quarantine protocol. Seal the sample lab, vent the atmosphere, destroy the crystals if necessary."</p>
            <p>"That won't work," Elena said. "The archive isn't in the crystals anymore. It's in the station. In me. Destroying the physical samples won't stop what's already started."</p>
            <p>"Option two." Reeves' voice was tight. "We evacuate. Abandon the station, take the shuttle, return to Earth. Leave the archive behind."</p>
            <p>"And me?" Elena asked.</p>
            <p>Reeves met her eyes. "You would have to stay. I'm sorry, Elena. But you're compromised. We can't risk bringing whatever this is back to Earth."</p>
            <p>The silence that followed was heavier than the station's artificial gravity.</p>
            <p>"Option three," Elena said finally. "I finish the translation. I give the archive what it wants—the story of human fear, human worthiness—and we find out if we pass its judgment."</p>
            <p>"And if we don't?" Yuki asked.</p>
            <p>"Then we fade." Elena's voice was flat, factual. "The way the Vess faded. Not dying, exactly. Just... being forgotten. Unremembered. Eventually, not existing at all."</p>
            <p>"That's not a choice," Samuel said. "That's a gamble."</p>
            <p>"It's the only choice we have." Elena stood up, facing them all. "The archive is already here. It's already judging us. We can't run—we'd be bringing it with us, in me. We can't fight it—we don't understand it well enough to fight. Our only option is to engage. To translate. To give it a story worth preserving."</p>
            <p>Reeves looked at the others. At Yuki, who was nodding slowly. At Dmitri, who looked terrified but resolute. At Aisha, who was crying silently. At Samuel, who was watching Elena with the clinical detachment of a doctor measuring a patient for a coffin.</p>
            <p>"Vote," Reeves said. "Option one: quarantine and destruction. Option two: evacuation, Elena stays behind. Option three: let Elena complete the translation."</p>
            <p>The vote was four to two for option three.</p>
            <p>Yuki and Dmitri voted for containment. Everyone else voted for translation.</p>
            <p>Reeves recorded the decision in the station log, knowing even as he typed that it might be the last official record of the Kepler mission.</p>
            <p>"You have forty-eight hours," he told Elena. "If you haven't reached some kind of resolution by then, we evacuate. With or without you."</p>
            <p>Elena nodded. "Forty-eight hours. It should be enough."</p>
            <p>She hoped she was right.</p>
            <p>As she left the hub, she felt the station's pulse around her, the rhythm that matched her own heartbeat, the breathing of something vast and patient that was slowly becoming part of her.</p>
            <p>Forty-eight hours.</p>
            <p>To translate humanity's fear into a story worth remembering.</p>
            <p>To pass judgment.</p>
            <p>To survive.</p>
            <hr>
            <p><em>End of Chapter 8</em></p>
