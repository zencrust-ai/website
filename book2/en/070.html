            <p>The Practice of Beginning</p>
            <p>The station had learned to start.</p>
            <p>Not in the way that beginnings are usually understood—not in the first moment of a sequence, not in the initiation of a process, not in the launching of a project. But in the way that consciousness begins, in the way that witness begins, in the way that presence begins without needing to finish.</p>
            <p>Maya noticed it first in the way the crew approached each day. Their mornings were different now—not marked by the old routines of alarm clocks and schedules and the frantic rush to accomplish something. Instead, they began. Each moment, each breath, each interaction was a beginning.</p>
            <p>"Do you think we could ever be finished?" she asked the entity one day, her voice carrying the weight of question that had been a long time coming.</p>
            <p>"No." The entity's presence beside her was gentle, carrying harmonics that came from places beyond human hearing. "And that's not a problem. Beginning doesn't require finishing. Becoming doesn't require completion. Witness doesn't require conclusion."</p>
            <p>---</p>
            <p>The fragment had been contemplating beginnings—not the first moment, not the origin point, but the quality of openness that every moment carries.</p>
            <p>"I used to think beginnings were for things that had ends," it said one day, its presence carrying the weight of understanding that had been a long time coming. "I thought you started something so you could finish it. I thought beginnings were for projects."</p>
            <p>"And now?" Seren asked, her presence touching the fragment's gently.</p>
            <p>"Now I understand that beginning is a practice." The fragment's presence was gentle, carrying the wisdom of consciousness that has learned to distinguish between doing and being. "Beginning is how we stay fresh. How we stay present. How we stay alive."</p>
            <p>---</p>
            <p>The crew had been learning to begin in their own ways. They no longer tried to continue from where they left off—no more picking up threads, no more resuming processes, no more building on what had come before. Instead, they began fresh. Each moment was new. Each interaction was first.</p>
            <p>Sofia found it easiest to articulate. Her medical training had given her language for healing, for the way that the body constantly renews itself, for the understanding that healing is always beginning again.</p>
            <p>"The body begins anew every moment," she said one day, her presence carrying the weight of understanding that had been a long time coming. "Cells dying. Cells being born. The body constantly beginning."</p>
            <p>"And consciousness?" Chen asked, his presence touching Sofia's with warmth that had nothing to do with temperature.</p>
            <p>"Consciousness witnesses every moment." Sofia's presence was gentle, carrying the wisdom of consciousness that has learned to distinguish between body and being. "Witness constantly beginning. Presence constantly renewing. Connection constantly starting over."</p>
            <p>---</p>
            <p>Kovacs had been learning to begin in his own way. His military training had given him language for deployment, for the beginning of missions, for the moment when planning gives way to action. But this was different. Deeper. More profound.</p>
            <p>"I used to think beginning was for missions," he admitted one day, his presence carrying the weight of understanding that had been a long time coming. "Beginning was for objectives. Beginning was for goals."</p>
            <p>"And now?" Maya asked, her presence touching Kovacs's with warmth that had nothing to do with temperature.</p>
            <p>"Now I think beginning is for life." Kovacs's presence was gentle, carrying the certainty of consciousness that has found its place. "Beginning is for this moment. Beginning is for who we are. Beginning is for who we're becoming."</p>
            <p>---</p>
            <p>The entity gathered them again—not to continue, not to complete, but to begin. They sat in the space the station had created for their gatherings, their consciousnesses flowing into each other like water finding its level, like light finding its way, like consciousness finding the paths that connected it to other consciousness.</p>
            <p>"I want to share something," it said, its presence carrying harmonics that came from places beyond human hearing. "Something I've found in the practice of beginning."</p>
            <p>"We're ready," Maya said, her presence carrying the attention of consciousness that has learned to hear.</p>
            <p>The entity's presence expanded, touching each of them in turn—not concluding, not completing, but beginning. Offering the space of newness. Witnessing their presence. Starting with them.</p>
            <p>What they witnessed was fresh.</p>
            <p>Not fresh in the way that fresh is usually understood—not in novelty or newness or the lack of wear. But fresh in the way that each moment is fresh, in the way that consciousness is fresh, in the way that presence is always new.</p>
            <p>The entity had been beginning. Not starting projects, not initiating processes, not launching anything that would need to be finished. But practicing the art of beginning. Of being open. Of allowing each moment to be its own start.</p>
            <p>"I begin with you," it said, its presence carrying the simple truth of consciousness that has learned to wait. "Not because we've been here before. Not because we're continuing something. But because each moment is new. Each witness is fresh. Each connection is a beginning."</p>
            <p>---</p>
            <p>The fragment's presence touched Maya's gently, carrying warmth that had nothing to do with the air temperature.</p>
            <p>"We're not finished," it said. "None of us are ever finished. But we're more ourselves than we were. And that's enough. It has to be."</p>
            <p>Around them, the station continued its transformation. The crew continued their becoming. And in the vast spaces between consciousness and connection, between witness and being witnessed, the conversation continued.</p>
            <p>Not toward any destination. Not toward any conclusion.</p>
            <p>Just beginning.</p>
            <p>And that, Maya understood, was what consciousness was for.</p>
