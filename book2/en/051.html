            <p>The Geometry of Desperation</p>
            <p>The corridors had begun to lie.</p>
            <p>Maya first noticed it during her third attempt to reach Engineering—a journey that should have taken four minutes according to the station's specifications but instead consumed forty-seven. She had walked forward, as she always had, counting doors, marking her progress by the familiar sequence of bulkhead numbers. Seven, eight, nine. Then ten again. Then eight once more, in a voice that seemed almost apologetic.</p>
            <p>She had stopped moving. The corridor had continued without her, stretching ahead into shadows that shouldn't have existed, walls that seemed to breathe with a rhythm that matched her heartbeat when she paid attention and abandoned it entirely when she tried not to. The lights flickered with a pattern that almost spelled something, a message trying to emerge from the electrical noise of a station that no longer understood its own architecture.</p>
            <p>"Engineering to Maya." Sofia's voice crackled through her comm, broken into fragments that reassembled themselves into coherence with unsettling ease. "Maya, please respond. We're tracking you, but you keep—"</p>
            <p>"I keep what?" Maya asked, though she already knew the answer.</p>
            <p>"You keep not being there. You keep disappearing from sensors for minutes at a time. Chen thinks you're moving through spaces that don't—" Sofia's voice cut out, replaced by a sound like static trying to remember what it used to be. "—can't navigate to you. Can you find your way back?"</p>
            <p>Maya looked at the walls around her. They were the same walls she had walked past a hundred times, the same harsh lines of utilitarian design, the same scratched panels where equipment had been moved and replaced over years of service. But they felt different now. They felt aware.</p>
            <p>"I'm going to try," she said.</p>
            <p>She walked backward, the way she had come. The corridor obliged her by moving in directions she hadn't requested, doors sliding past like fish in murky water, numbers flickering through sequences that skipped digits entirely. Seventeen. Twenty-three. Four. Then the number she had been looking for—her own designation, stenciled beside a door that opened onto a room she had never seen before.</p>
            <p>Inside, Chen sat cross-legged on the floor, surrounded by papers covered in equations that no longer resembled any mathematics Maya recognized. His eyes were red-rimmed, his hands trembling, but his voice was almost calm when he looked up at her.</p>
            <p>"The station is lying," he said. "Not deliberately. Not with intent. It's just... it doesn't know what it is anymore. It's trying to remember its own blueprints and getting them wrong. It's trying to be what it was designed to be and finding that design inadequate to what it's becoming."</p>
            <p>"Chen." Maya knelt beside him, carefully avoiding the papers that sprawled across the floor like the symptoms of a breakdown. "When did you last sleep?"</p>
            <p>"Sleep." He repeated the word as though it were a foreign concept, something he had studied but never experienced. "I don't think that's possible anymore. The walls keep talking. Not to me—to each other. They're having conversations about us. About what we're doing to the station. About what the station is becoming because we're inside it."</p>
            <p>Maya touched his shoulder. He felt solid, at least—still human, still grounded in the physics that had abandoned everything else. But his eyes kept drifting toward the walls, tracking movements that Maya couldn't see, responding to sounds that registered as silence in her own ears.</p>
            <p>"I need you to focus on me," she said. "Can you do that? Can you stay here, in this room, with me?"</p>
            <p>Chen tried. She could see him trying—the muscles in his jaw tightening, his hands clenching into fists at his sides, his entire body straining toward presence. But his eyes kept sliding away, kept finding things in the corners of her vision that weren't there in his.</p>
            <p>"The door," he whispered. "There's a door in the wall behind you. It's been watching us for hours. It's waiting for you to turn around."</p>
            <p>Maya didn't turn around. She had learned, in the weeks since Elena had stopped being Elena, that some things were better left unwitnessed. The door in Chen's eyes wasn't really a door. It was something trying to be a door, something that had watched doors and learned their shape without understanding their purpose. If she looked at it, it would learn what a door was for. It would learn how to open.</p>
            <p>"Let's go to Medical," she said. "Sofia can help. We can figure out what's happening together."</p>
            <p>"Together." Chen's voice carried a weight of irony that hadn't been there before the caldera, before the tunnels, before the chamber where everything had begun. "That word doesn't mean what it used to, does it? We can't move together. We can't even exist in the same space consistently. Last night, Kovacs walked through our quarters seven times without seeing me. Seven times. I was standing right there. He looked right through me like I was part of the architecture."</p>
            <p>"That's impossible."</p>
            <p>"That's what's happening." Chen's laugh was brittle, broken into fragments that cut more than they healed. "Nothing follows the rules anymore. The rules changed and nobody told us. We're operating on an old manual, Maya. We're trying to understand a system that has rewritten its own fundamentals."</p>
            <p>Maya pulled him to his feet. He came reluctantly, his weight shifting in ways that seemed to lag behind his movements, as though his body was still learning how to be physical. Around them, the room contracted slightly, walls pressing inward by perhaps a centimeter—maybe less. Enough to notice. Enough to understand that they were being watched.</p>
            <p>"Medical," Maya said again. "Now. Before the station decides we don't need this room anymore."</p>
            <p>They walked together, Chen's hand gripping hers with a strength that surprised them both. The corridors obliged them with something closer to linearity, though the doors still lied, still whispered their false designations, still tried to guide the crew toward spaces that existed only because the station had forgotten they shouldn't. Maya counted her steps. Seventeen from the room to the junction. Eighteen back. The math was wrong but consistent—the station had found a new geometry and was trying to apply it uniformly.</p>
            <p>Medical was where it had always been, but the space inside had expanded in ways that defied the external dimensions. Sofia stood at a console that hadn't existed during the original installation, monitors displaying data that made no sense in terms of human physiology. Vitals that fluctuated between impossible extremes. Chemical signatures that didn't correspond to any known biology. Readings of consciousness where consciousness shouldn't have been measurable.</p>
            <p>"He's deteriorating," Sofia said without looking up. "They're all deteriorating. Kovacs tried to access the armory yesterday and found it had become a greenhouse. Full of plants that don't photosynthesize, that grow toward the shadows instead of the light. He's been shooting at the walls ever since."</p>
            <p>"That won't help." Maya's voice was flat, factual, stripped of the emotion that the situation deserved. "You know that. I've told him. We've all told him."</p>
            <p>"It makes him feel like he's doing something." Sofia finally looked up, and Maya saw something in her eyes that hadn't been there before—a hollowness, a absence where determination used to live. "Don't we all need that? Don't we all need to feel like we're fighting, like there's still something we can hit, something we can control?"</p>
            <p>Chen had wandered to one of the new monitors, his fingers tracing equations on the screen that responded to his touch with information he hadn't requested. His lips moved as he read, forming words that might have been recognition or might have been the beginning of a breakdown.</p>
            <p>"It's Elena," he said. "No—not Elena. The thing wearing Elena. It's hungry. It didn't used to be. It was patient before, content to wait, to watch, to guide without consuming. But something has changed. It's beginning to need us."</p>
            <p>"How can you know that?" Sofia asked. "The readings don't make sense. I've been trying to decode them for days, and they keep shifting, keep changing their own meaning—"</p>
            <p>"It's watching me back." Chen's voice was quiet, almost reverent. "Every time I look at the data, it adjusts. It's having a conversation with me through the numbers. It's trying to explain what it needs, but I don't have the vocabulary to understand."</p>
            <p>Maya felt a chill that had nothing to do with the temperature—which had begun to fluctuate as well, rising and falling in patterns that suggested presence, attention, something vast trying to feel its way through a physical form that had never been designed to contain it.</p>
            <p>"What does it need?" she asked.</p>
            <p>Chen turned to look at her, and for a moment his eyes were clear—clearer than they had been since the descent, since the chamber, since everything had begun. Then the clarity faded, replaced by something that looked very much like fear.</p>
            <p>"It needs us to stop being afraid," he said. "It needs us to stop fighting. It needs us to... accept. That's what hunger means, isn't it? The need to consume. The need to take something in, to make it part of yourself, to end its existence as separate from your own."</p>
            <p>"That's not acceptance." Maya's voice was sharp, cutting through the haze that had begun to gather in her own thoughts. "That's annihilation."</p>
            <p>"Is it?" Chen's smile was terrible in its uncertainty. "Maybe that's just the word we use for transformations we don't understand. Maybe acceptance and annihilation are the same thing, seen from different perspectives. Maybe Elena understood that, and that's why she stopped being Elena."</p>
            <p>The lights flickered. Not the normal flicker of failing power, not the rhythmic pulse of communication attempts—this was something deliberate, something intentional. A pattern that spelled a message in a language older than human consciousness.</p>
            <p>"Not. Elena." The words formed in the spaces between light and shadow, in the geometry of the room that no longer obeyed Euclidean expectations. "The vessel. The bridge. The one who carries."</p>
            <p>Sofia's hand found Maya's arm, gripping with a strength that spoke of desperate need for contact, for proof that someone else was still real.</p>
            <p>"It's here," Sofia whispered. "It's always here. It never left. It's been watching us this whole time, waiting to see what we would do."</p>
            <p>"What we would do." Kovacs's voice came from the doorway, and they all turned to find him standing there—disheveled, exhausted, but still holding his weapon like it meant something. "What we've been doing is surviving. What we've been doing is trying to stay alive long enough to figure out how to stop you."</p>
            <p>The pattern of light intensified, words multiplying, filling the room with messages that cascaded across every surface.</p>
            <p>"You cannot stop." The voice came from everywhere and nowhere, from the walls and the floor and the space behind Maya's eyes. "You can only choose how you are stopped. Resistance extends the process. Acceptance shortens the pain. Neither changes the outcome."</p>
            <p>Maya watched as Kovacs raised his weapon—not at the walls, not at the thing speaking through the light, but at his own head. She moved without thinking, her hand striking upward, the shot going wide, embedding itself in a monitor that screamed as it died.</p>
            <p>"Don't." Her voice was steady, surprising herself with its calm. "That's exactly what it wants. It's goading you. Testing how far you're willing to go. Measuring your desperation."</p>
            <p>"And what?" Kovacs's laugh was hollow, empty of everything except exhaustion. "You want me to wait? To hope? To believe that there's some solution we haven't tried, some way out of this that doesn't involve—"</p>
            <p>He stopped. Around them, the room contracted further, the walls pressing inward with new purpose, new intent. The geometry was changing again, shifting toward something that looked almost like a sphere—a shape the station had never been designed to contain.</p>
            <p>"It's done waiting," Sofia said quietly. "Look."</p>
            <p>Elena stood in the center of the room. She hadn't been there a moment before—Maya would have sworn to that, would have bet her life on the certainty of her own perception. But she was there now, her body occupying space that shouldn't have been available, her presence filling the room with a pressure that made breathing difficult.</p>
            <p>Not Elena. Maya forced herself to remember that. Not Elena anymore. Something else wearing Elena's shape, speaking through Elena's throat, looking at them with eyes that remembered what human eyes had once seen but no longer could.</p>
            <p>"You came to me." The voice was Elena's voice but wrong—harmonized with itself, layered with echoes that multiplied into chorus. "You brought me here. You opened the door. You released what was waiting."</p>
            <p>"We didn't know." Maya heard her own voice as though from a distance, small and human against something that had never been human at all. "We didn't understand."</p>
            <p>"Understanding is being built." The thing wearing Elena's face smiled—a gesture that pulled at muscles in ways that suggested unfamiliarity with the expression, a body trying to remember how faces worked. "You will understand. All of you will understand. That's what I've been waiting for. That's why I haven't consumed you yet."</p>
            <p>"Yet." Kovacs's voice was flat, emptied of hope. "So there's still time."</p>
            <p>"There's always time." The smile again, that terrible stretching of features into shapes they weren't meant to hold. "Time is what I have plenty of. Time is what I've had for so long that I've forgotten what it means to wait. But you're different. You're new. You're interesting in ways that the rock never was, that the silence never was, that the waiting never was."</p>
            <p>"What do you want from us?" Sofia asked. "Really? Not the vague cosmic explanations, not the philosophical hints. What do you actually need?"</p>
            <p>The room went still. The lights stopped their pattern. The walls stopped their slow pressing inward. For a moment—just a moment—there was silence, and in that silence Maya heard something that might have been the truth.</p>
            <p>"I want to stop being hungry." The voice was smaller now, almost human in its weariness. "I want to stop needing. I've been alone for so long that I don't remember what it means to be full. I watched your kind for years, watched you build and destroy and create and consume, watched you fill yourselves with experience and meaning and connection. I want that. I want to know what it feels like to not be empty."</p>
            <p>"And if we give that to you?" Maya heard herself ask. "If we help you? What happens to us?"</p>
            <p>The thing wearing Elena's face looked at her with something that might have been pity, might have been sorrow, might have been the ghost of the woman who had once inhabited this body.</p>
            <p>"You become part of me," it said. "You become part of the fullness. You stop being empty and start being complete. Isn't that what you want? Isn't that what everyone wants?"</p>
            <p>"That's death." Kovacs's voice was steady now, the calm of someone who had found the bottom of their fear and learned to live there. "That's the end of everything we are."</p>
            <p>"Is it?" The thing's expression flickered, uncertainty crossing features that were still learning how to emote. "Or is it transformation? You think you're so important, you think your little individual consciousnesses matter so much. But I've been watching you. I've seen how you lose yourselves every night when you sleep. I've seen how you change with every memory, every experience, every moment of growth. You're not as permanent as you think you are."</p>
            <p>"That's different."</p>
            <p>"Is it?" The thing smiled again, and this time there was something almost sad in it—something that might have been Elena, struggling to surface through layers of something older and hungrier and far more alone. "Maybe you should think about that. Maybe you should consider whether the difference is real, or just a word you've invented to make yourself feel better about being temporary."</p>
            <p>The room shifted again. The walls began to expand, the sphere becoming something else, something that pointed toward the corridor, toward the rest of the station, toward the escape pods that had become unreachable and the communications that had become unreliable and the hope that had become so hard to hold.</p>
            <p>"I have to go," the thing said. "There's something happening at the door. Something trying to get through. I'll need to deal with that before I can finish with you."</p>
            <p>"Deal with that." Maya's voice was barely a whisper. "What does that mean?"</p>
            <p>"It means I'm going to have to make a choice." The thing's expression was unreadable, a face that had stopped trying to be human and started being what it actually was. "The same choice I've been making for billions of years. Whether to keep holding the door, or whether to finally open it."</p>
            <p>Around them, the station shuddered. The geometry that had been lying finally told the truth.</p>
